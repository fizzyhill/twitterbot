# twitterbot

Fun class project building a Twitter bot with tweepy and feedparser. 

It tweets about tech - stories from the RSS feed of Wired, Quartz, and The Verge, and retweets tweets that mention a set of tech-related keywords.

To get a taste of the results go follow my bot @grand1nqu1s1tor. It has a Russian name!
